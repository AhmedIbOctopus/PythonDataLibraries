# Master Python and Data Libraries Certification Bootcamp

Data science is a very wide field, and one of the promising fields that is spreading in a fast way, also, it is one of the very rewarding, and it is increasing in expansion day by day, due to its great importance and benefits, as it is the future.

Data science enables companies to measure, track, and record performance metrics for facilitating and enhancing decision making. Companies can analyze trends to make critical decisions to engage customers better, enhance company performance, and increase profitability.
And the employment of data science and its tools depends on the purpose you want from them.

For example, using data science in health care is very different from using data science in finance and accounting, and so on. And I’ll show you the core libraries for data handling, analysis and visualization which you can use in different areas.

One of the most powerful programming languages that are used for Data science is Python, which is an easy, simple and very powerful language with many libraries and packages that facilitate working on complex and different types of data.
